# Radix Sort

Radix sort is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by groupin Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort an array of numbers. 
Because integers can be used to represent strings (by hashing the strings to integers), radix sort works on data types other than just integers.

## The Radix Sort Algorithm
1) Do following for each digit i where i varies from least significant digit to the most significant digit.

 - Sort input array using counting sort (or any stable sort) according to the iâ€™th digit.

Let us understand it with the help of an example.

```javascript
Original, unsorted list:

170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66
Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives: [*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 170 & 90 and 45 & 75.]

170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66
Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives: [*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 2 in the previous list.]

802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90
Sorting by most significant digit (100s place) gives:

2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802
```
