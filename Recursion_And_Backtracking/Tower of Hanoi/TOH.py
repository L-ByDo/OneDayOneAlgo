# Problem Statement
"""
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,
obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks
and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved
if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
