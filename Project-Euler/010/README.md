# Problem 10

We are required to fid the sum of all prime numbers below 2 Million.
If we use a for loop to obtain all prime numbers upto 2 Million and then sum them,
our code will take a lot of time to obtain the answer.
Instead of this, we will use the Seive method by Eratosthenes to mark all prime numbers
and then sum them. This solution will only take a few milliseconds to produce an answer.
