# Problem 9

Given that the perimeter of a right angled triangle is 1000, we need to find the lenghts of its three sides.
We know that sides of right angled triangl follow the *Pythagoras theorem* :
**a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>**

We will use this theorem to code our solution in python.
